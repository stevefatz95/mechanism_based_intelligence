# Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI)

This repository contains the implementation and supplementary materials for **Mechanism-Based Intelligence (MBI)**, illustrating its principles, the Differentiable Price Mechanism (DPM) and incentive-aligned multi-agent optimization.

## Overview

MBI is a framework that integrates **economics**, **mechanism design**, **incentive alignment** and **differentiable computation** to achieve globally optimal outcomes in multi-agent systems.

The **DPM** translates global objectives into high-information, local corrective signals guiding agents toward emergent collective intelligence. 

### Current Contents

This repo currently includes:

* `notebooks/mbi_appendix_c.ipynb` – A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the implementation of MBI principles and toy examples.
* `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies required to run the notebook.
